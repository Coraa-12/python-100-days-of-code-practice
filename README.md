Hey, I'm Tegar Wijaya Kusuma, a Computer Science student based in Tangerang, Indonesia. Passionate about backend development and test automation. Currently exploring DevOps tools like Docker and building CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions.

This repository tracks my progress and contains my code solutions for the exercises and projects completed during the Udemy course: **[100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)**.

The goal is to practice consistently and build a strong foundation in Python, covering areas like automation, web development, data science, and more.

## Structure

Each day's work from the course curriculum is organized into its corresponding `day-XX` folder (e.g., `day-01`, `day-02`).

* The main files within `day-XX` folders are solutions to the official course exercises and mini-projects.
* Some `day-XX` folders may also contain an **`extra_challenges/` subfolder**. This subfolder holds solutions to supplementary practice problems related to that day's topic, often generated with AI assistance for extra reinforcement and skill refinement.

## Main Course Projects Repository

The primary, standalone projects built for each day of the "100 Days of Code" Udemy course are hosted in a separate repository. This current repository contains the smaller exercises, code snippets, and supplementary practice related to the daily concepts.

**To see the main completed projects (like the Day 1 Band Name Generator, Day 2 Tip Calculator, etc.), please visit:**

## Progress Log & Topics

This table tracks completed days and links to the folder containing exercises/notes for that day within this repository.

*(A reminder to myself to update this table as I complete each day!)*

## Learning Goals

* Complete the 100 Days of Code challenge through consistent practice.
* Master Python fundamentals and explore advanced topics (Web Dev, Data Science, APIs, GUI, Automation).
* Develop strong problem-solving skills.
* Build a portfolio of diverse Python projects.
