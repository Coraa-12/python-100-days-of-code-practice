# Debugging Challenge:

# Here's a piece of code with a syntax error:

# name = input("Enter your name")
# print("Hello, " + name
# age = input("Enter your age")
# print("You are " + age + " years old.")

# Identify and fix the syntax error so that the code runs correctly.

name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name)
age = input("Enter your age: ")
print("You are " + age + " years old.")
